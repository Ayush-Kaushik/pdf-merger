## 🏁 About <a name = "#getting_started"></a>
I created this tool to simplify the process of merging multiple files into a single large file while working with a large volume of PDF's containing sensitive information.

Attaching multiple documents to an email can be tedious, and there is a chance that a user could forget a file. Online free options are available, but they pose a security threat as it requires uploading PDF's.

This desktop application merges all the PDF, JPG\JPEG, and PNG files into a single large file.

The tool currently supports following formats:
- `PDF`
- `JPG\JPEG`
- `PNG`
