## 🏁 About <a name = "#getting_started"></a>
I had the idea to create this tool while working with large volume of PDF's containing `sensitive information`. 

Attaching multiple documents to an email is tedious and there are chances that a user could forget a file.

There are online "Free" options available but I didn't want to upload PDF's to as it could pose a security threat. 

I created this desktop application that merges all the `PDF's` files into single large file.

The tool currently supports following formats:

- `PDF`
- `JPG\JPEG`
- `PNG`
