## 🏁 About <a name = "#getting_started"></a>
I had the idea to create this tool while working with large volume of PDF's with secure information. When exchanging
these documents via Email I needed a tool to combine multiple PDF's into single one. 

There are online "Free" options available but I didn't want to upload PDF's to as it could pose a security threat. Hence, I created this desktop application that merges all these pdf files into single file.

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>  
- The application is divided into three parts. Top most part has a button labelled `Save To`. When user clicks this button, a pop up appears where user can select the location to save their merged PDF file.
- Middle half has a big shaded area, this location allows user to drag and drop multiple PDF files that will be merged.
- User can also order the files in sequence they want them to appear in merged outcome.
- Finally, at the bottom, we have two buttons: `Merge` and `Cancel`.
- When user clicks on merge, the merging process will start and file named `merged.pdf` will be placed in 
the location specified by user
- When user presses `Cancel`, the application is reset so user can perform the merge operation on new set of files again.
